<h1>Google Review Reply Bot</h1>
<ol>
  <li>This application uses NLP to analyse sentiments of the reviews using a pre-trained algorithm and then uses LDA trained bagofwords or TfIdf based models to predict the topics of the array. The dataset used is a culmination of various datasets I found on the internet</li>
  <li>There is also a front end planned to be made for the application.</li>
  <li>A Google My Busniness like review/rating/reply display is shown and it performs the work of Google's API, for free.</li>
